# V1 PAC3
A PAC model of V1, Slide animation, Dash animation, and first person weapon viewmodels.
All done by the lovely "Death"

# Installation

Plop Ultramove into steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/data/expression2

and place the Pac3 file in garrysmod/data/pac3

# Intallation Explained
First make sure you have Wiremod, Plycore, Antcore and Nexuscore installed through the workshop.

Propcore is already inside of Wiremod but must be enabled by commandline.

Download ultracoin as a zip file using the "code" dropdown in github, colored as a green box.

If opening Garry'sMod directory through steam, right click the game in the library, go to properties, local files, browse local files. Then navigate the folders to get to "Garry'sMod/garrysmod/data/expression2"

Place the script text files into the expression2 folder.

If your game was already running, open the wire tab of your spawnmenu, open the Expression2 tool, and click "update" to refresh all available script listings so that the recently added scripts now show up.

Both Ultracoin and Ultramove go into the steam/steamapps/common/Garrys Mod/garrysmod/data/expression2 
Folder

But the PAC3 file included in ultramove.zip needs to be placed into Garrys Mod/garrysmod/data/pac3


A few necessary in-game console commands are

wire_holograms_modelany 1

wire_expression2_extension_enable propcore

wire_expression2_concmd 1

The first command allows the new vfx for coinshot to show, the second allows it to even work, and the third allows the movement E2 to play the PAC's sliding animation on your playermodel

# To Use

your sprint key will allow you to dash in any held movement direction. This will consume stamina.

jumping will make you go higher. Use your crouch key to slam into the ground and splatter anyone underneath you.

Stamina will recharge to a maximum of 3 dashes worth.

You can wall jump up to 3 consecutive times, then need to touch the ground to recharge walljumps.

Holding crouch while on the ground will make you slide in any direction you are looking or moving. You will keep going until you let go.

# Advanced Usage

You can SLIDEHOP by starting a slide and then jumping. On servers with accelerated backhops allowed, looking in the opposite of your slide direction and then jumping will fling you a long ways.

You can SLAM STORAGE by groundslamming into a simultaneous wall jump. As you hit the ground, press and hold space bar to launch your self into space.

You can STOMP by dashing and then slamming in rapid succession. It is called this because you dont even need to be airborn to achieve the rather destiny-like AOE, and instead cause the slam to trigger by the act of dashing alone counting as viable grounds to trigger a valid slam.
